# refine-autobot

ODI Experiment, unsuported, no warrenty.

This is a small demonstration of a service that takes a OpenRefine operation history and can programatically apply it to new files. 

## Supported opperations

Mass find/replace of text from one value to another. This results from clustering.

Translation of a column of strings to a number, specifically ("3,321,321" to 3321321)

That's it! It is only a demo to show it is possible.

Expand getClean.php if you want more.
